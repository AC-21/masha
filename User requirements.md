I am creating a website and have the mockup of how we need it to look like, I need you to analyze this, analyze the components, the sizing, dependancies, the corner roundedness, the fon't sizes.

We will then host out using vercel (Automated deploy), github (Create a repo and start this), Supabase (If needed).


We will also need to have a calendly link in text form, and to embed a calendly calendar for the website, i have 2 versions  created, and need it respnsive to the frame size. 

It must load very fast, be snappy, and unqiue, and well built.

I need you to plan this project/your tasks in one markdown document, and I need you to create another document that is a sequence of tasks required to complete this. I Also have a high quality jpeg (Can export to another file type in Lightroom, for the image)

Map the file structure, take inspration from @Fig design files, then create a plan to make this happen.
