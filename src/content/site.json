    "i am deeply in love with what i do.",
    "it has been a struggle, though, to express in a sentence or two what it really is.",
    "i cultivate an environment where a person can come exactly as they are, feeling accepted and loved in their pain, inner battles, fears, desires, brightness, uniqueness, comfort, and discomfort.",
    "it is the most beautiful thing each time to witness someone opening up and beginning to love and accept themselves. my heart feels so full guiding and witnessing the beautiful transformations happening within people.",
    "recently, i have realized another core reason why i love it so much: since i was little, i have always wanted to connect with people on the truest, deepest level. i have always felt uncomfortable in scenarios where we all tend to follow a \"normal,\" superficial way of interacting, often not speaking to how we truly feel, what we experience, what is burning or crying inside of us, what is real. but with people who choose to work with me, i get to see so much of their inner world, and the part of me that craves intimacy and truth feels safe.",
    "so, it is not \"work.\" it is the time when my heart feels so grateful to connect with another in what really matters, to recognize each other's souls behind the masks, while acknowledging the masks and their purpose, as well as other infinite parts of ourselves. this precious time of heartfelt connection is healing for me, too.",
    "and that is why i can be grateful for my own suffering. it has led me to what i thought i was missing - deeper meaning and purpose. it made me realize what turning pain into a gift means for me. sitting with it, working with plant medicine, spending days and nights suffocated inside my own misery, studying modalities - all of it so i can relate, guide, listen, understand, and hopefully help more and more people feel seen, whole, loved, and not alone. alienation, shame, and keeping our suffering to ourselves only create more suffering. seeing each other through eyes and hearts of truth and compassion is the only way that will create sustainable change - for the highest good of all."

      "short": "One of my favorite modalities - it views the human being as a constellation of distinct “parts,” each carrying its own expression, frequency, story, feelings, and emotions.",
      "long": "\nSome parts feel excited and confident, some are driven by defense and rage, while others are tender, sensitive, and vulnerable. These inner characters often clash, pulling us in different directions, keeping us stuck in doubt, unhelpful behaviors, or the inability to move forward.\n\nBy listening closely to our physical sensations and emotions, we begin to trace how these parts speak through the body and mind. When given space to express and release their burdens, inner conflicts ease, opening us to a life of clarity, vitality, creativity, and deeper connection. This process gives us the chance to find the answers we seek within, to know ourselves on the deepest level, to cultivate forgiveness and presence, and to uncover our gifts so we can create the life we truly desire.\n\nIFS is the process of connecting to each part and giving it the stage it never had, allowing fears to become inspiration and emotions to reveal themselves as messengers of truth. It is a uniting of body awareness with self-understanding, sparking transformation that arises from within."

      "short": "Inner child work is a tender yet empowering process of meeting the younger parts of ourselves with compassion and curiosity, giving them the love and safety they always longed for.",
      "long": "\nIn this space, old hurts soften and unmet needs are finally seen without judgment. When those inner parts are embraced rather than pushed away, we discover deeper meaning in life, the ability to build safe and fulfilling relationships, and a grounded confidence in being true to ourselves. From that space comes our true freedom and liberation—the ability to live with openness, joy, and authenticity."

      "title": "**Movement Therapy**",
      "short": "Our bodies hold memories and stories that our minds can’t always capture. In this process, I safely guide you into the world of sensation, gradually rebuilding your connection to the body—its sensitivity and the unique wisdom it holds.",
      "long": "\nMy journey with my body has been long and often painful, marked by chronic health issues that made me see my body as an enemy since childhood. Over time, I realized those symptoms were signals, revealing deeper emotional and ancestral patterns that needed attention and resolution. By slowing down, listening to the body, and gently rewiring the nervous system, we gain more freedom and self-compassion.\n\nThrough somatic work, I aim to help you uncover your body’s wisdom so you can move beyond stuckness, discomfort and limiting beliefs. We’ll explore how your physical sensations connect to both personal and inherited stories, then use this awareness to foster resilience, clarity, and authentic self-expression. In essence, your body becomes your best a friend and guide to greater well-being and personal expansion, rather than an obstacle and something to “deal with”."

      "title": "**Emotional Release**",
      "short": "I provide a safe and contained space for you to express the emotions that often seem unacceptable. Often, our most “undesirable” feelings are the ones crying out to be witnessed; they hold gifts we rarely see until we give them space to express.",
      "long": "\nWhen granted acknowledgment and release, they can lead to a clearer sense of self, renewed emotional balance and inspiration. \n\nTogether, we will learn how to safely feel, accept and process anger, rage, sadness and other feelings we often were punished and ridiculed for. Restoring the balance in our emotional landscape is the way to deeper self-love, excitement, and fulfilling relationships."

      "long": "\nRevealing our vulnerable truth in a safe space is a profound act of courage, offering both relief and sense of power. In our interactions, your truth, authenticity, fears, doubts, dreams, desires - all of you - is celebrated, accepted, and deeply loved."

      "title": "**Prayer**",
      "short": "I view prayer as a technology for clarifying thought, learning to align our intentions with the path of our soul, and aligning with higher dimensions—God, Unconditional Love, Source, Light - exploring what “higher power” feels like to you, and healing that relationship.",
      "long": "\nI’m not religious, and my approach to prayer is free from any dogma.\n\nThrough prayer, we learn to set clear direction for our true heart desires to manifest and integrate with the most beneficial outcome for ourselves, the people and our planet, stepping into co-creation with our higher self and the benevolent unseen realms, developing dissernment in navigating spiritual and physical realms."

      "short": "At times, we feel severed from our true selves, from real love, or from life’s deeper meaning—numb or uncertain about the emotional weight we carry. The truth is, we already hold the keys to our own freedom.",
      "long": "\nParts of us exiled by shame or fear can transform into potent sources of liberation and creativity once we approach them with compassion and curiosity. These \"shadow\" facets aren’t our enemies; they’re mosaics of hidden power, conditioning and ancestral influences—mechanisms that once helped us navigate life. Now, they beg for a safe space and attentive presence so they can finally share their message. Leaning in, rather than pushing them away, allows these parts to emerge and guide us toward deeper self-awareness and an authentic sense of wholeness."
